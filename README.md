# the-game
game made with kivy to improve my english and my knowledge in python.

## Purpose
To do a game in free time, and to have some fun.

The reason I'm doing this is to study more about object-oriented programming (OOP) and the Kivy Framework to start making more useful applications to automate my day-to-day life.
